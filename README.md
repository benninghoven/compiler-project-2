Given the following CFG and the parsing table, write a program to trace
input strings over { id, +, *, ), ( } and ending with $.

Test it on three input strings (1) (id+id)*id$ (2) id*id$ (3) (id*)$

Show the content of the stack implementation for each case. Output must be
displayed along the stack implementation.

Output (Example):
Input: (id+id)$
Stack:
Step Stack Input Action

Output: String is accepted/ String is not accepted.

Draw the Parse Tree for each case. Save this information in a document
named “tree_mydesign”.

You must write a report file to briefly specify documentation & how to
setup/run your program if needed. Document the code, processes, roles, and
results in this file.

Your executable program, which is supposed to be developed in
C/C++/Java/Python, should represent the implementation of your idea.

Your submission must have Three (3) files: your design file, your program
file, and a documentation file. The Design file and Documentation file
should be submitted in PDF format. Upload it in canvas (either the zip file or
GitHub link).

Remember, the journey is as important as the destination. All the best!
